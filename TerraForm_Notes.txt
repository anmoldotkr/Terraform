-------------------- TerraForm ---------------------------

what is this Terraform? 
TerraForm is bascially a IAC (infrastructure as Code) tool created by hasicorp.
and files written in Json or HCL (Hashicorp configuration language).

What is Hashicorp?
It is a software company that builds IAC tools espacially in cloud environment.

What is HCL?
It is the domain specific language used to write-configuration files for terraform.
files extenxsion = .tf

why we need this terraform ?
Imagine you work for a startup that hosts its application on AWS.

ðŸ”´ Without Terraform:
You log in to the AWS Console.

Manually create:

1 EC2 instance for the app.
1 RDS database.
1 S3 bucket for storing user files.
A security group, IAM roles, etc.
You do this again for:
Staging
Production
Every time thereâ€™s an update

with Terraform: 
Terraform can define all of this in code and deploy it automatically.

----------------- Syntax: Block, arguments & Atrributes ------------------

block parameters {
//
  arguments
// 
}

Example: Create a terraform hcl code for creating the text file in your local?

solution: So, first this is resources 
block = resources
paramters = local_file
name_of _the_file = myfile
arguments = filename and i want some content in this file

resource "local_file" "my_file" {
    filename = "automate.txt"
    content = "This text file is created by terraform"  
}

to execute thi file first run [it will provide the environment to terraform to execute cmd]
terraform init ( one time run)
terraform validate (it will validate the syntax of terraform)
terraform plan (it will show the plan before the creating resoruces)
terraform apply (it will execute the .tf file)

------------- Boom file is created ----------------------------


############ Important ###########
